# MEAN Movie  
>This project was generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)

It's about a simple CRUD of movies, containing a title and an url.
For the url - for the sake of not just showing the it to the final user - I created a angular directive called youtube, which embeds the video to the page.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
